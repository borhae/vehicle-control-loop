Note: simulation in V-Rep is by default set to stop around 1000 units from the center (defining a sphere). 
Many of these simulations here require larger areas, so one must enlarge this default setting in the following way:
In V-Rep's install folder go to:  system/ and open: usrset.txt In section Various change
dynamicActivityRange = 1000 to a larger value (10000 is already enough).
