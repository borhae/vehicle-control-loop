* I sometimes had the issue of V-Rep running super slow. After a while I figured that it wasn't using the graphics card any more. It speeded up to normal when I attached graphical run settings from the NVIDIA Control Panel
-> Start application NVIDIA Control Panel
-> In Treeview (select a Task...) expand "3D Settings"
-> select "Manag 3D settings" 
-> In tab "Program Settings"
-> Add CoppeliaSim from the file System in "Select a program to customize"
-> apply (go with default settings)
-> fixed the slow down
